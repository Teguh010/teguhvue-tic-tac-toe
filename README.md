##  Overview

- This Tic Tac Toe Game made by Vue Js


## the steps in working on this project

##  Step 1

> The square logic

### Goal

Display an **X** when the player **X** clicks on an empty square, and display an **O** when the player **O** clicks on an empty square.


##  Step 2

> The game status

### Goal

Display **X** and **O** with different colors, display the game status (next player, winner or draw game).


##  Step 3

> Highlight the winner


##  Step 4

> Restart the game

### Goal

Improve the UX (User eXperience) by allowing users to restart the game without reloading the whole application.


##  Step 5 (advanced workshop)

> Routing and shared state

### Goal

Add a lobby page before starting the game. In this lobby, you shall be able to name the players.


#### Configure Vue-Router

- Add the dependency `vue-router` to your package.json with the command `yarn add vue-router`.
- Configure two paths for your app, one for the `Lobby` component and the other one to your `Board` component.
- Change `App.vue` to hold routing logic.
- The app should now point by default to the Lobby component and the restart button should also bring you back to the Lobby.

#### Configure VueX

- Add the dependency `vuex` to your package.json with the command `yarn add vuex`.
- Add player names to the Vuex store to share these data across your components.
- The `Status` component can now retrieve player names from the store.

##  Step 6 (bonus)

> Unit Tests

### Goal

Add unit tests to make sure that the game meets all expectations and to prevent breaking changes.
